[Overview]

Caps cpu utilisation of a process, a group of processes or a tree of processes from user-space. Useful in the scenario where the process consumes 100% of the cpu all the time, but the user wants the process only to consume "x%" of the cpu. 


--------

[Features]

Process ID needs to be specified using -p, -g or -t
CPULeash: Keeps a given running process leashed under a certain cpu utilization threshold
Usage:
cpuleash (-l scaled_percent | -L absolute_percent) -p pid [-s sample_time] [-v] [-h]
-l: Comma seperated scaled percent value for each of the process specified in -p. Range [0, 100]. Target cpu value divided by the number of cpu 
    in the system. Current system: 8
-L: Comma seperated absolute percent value for each of the process specified in -p. Range [0, 800]. Target cpu value is absolute.
-j: Scaled percent value for the process group list specified in -g or for the entire process tree with the root specified in -t. Range [0, 100]. Target cpu value divided by the number of cpu 
    in the system. Current system: 8
-J: Scaled percent value for the process group list specified in -g or for the entire process tree with the root specified in -t. Range [0, 800]. Target cpu value is absolute.
-p: Comma seperated PIDs to leash
-g: Comma seperated PIDs to be leashed as one group
-t: PID of the parent process, whole entire children tree is to be leashed as a group
-s: Sample time in seconds. Default 1.0s (optional)
-v: Verbose
-h: Shows this help

Option -p is mandatory. 
-l and -L are mutually exclusive and mandatory.

Example: The invocation `cpuleash -L 33,55,66,77 -p 123,456,789,345' will leash the PIDs to the corresponding percentages

Example: The invocation `cpuleash -J 50 -g 123,456,789,345' will leash the PIDs as a group to be within 50% absolute threshold

Example: The invocation `cpuleash -J 50 -t 123' will leash the given PID and auto-populated children of it as a group to be within 50% absolute threshold
